3. Access the third character
------------------------------------------

my_string = "Hello World"  # Creates a string
third_char = my_string[2]  # Index 2 is the third character
print(third_char)  # Output: 'l'


Explanation: String indexing starts at 0. [0]='H', [1]='e', [2]='l'.

Note: Strings are immutable - can't change individual characters.
