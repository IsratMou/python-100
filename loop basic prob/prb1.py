'''
1. Print numbers 1 to 10
python
for num in range(1, 11):  # range(1,11) = 1 to 10
    print(num)
Explanation:

range(start, stop) generates numbers from start to stop-1 (11 is excluded).

num takes each value in the range.

Alternative (while loop):

python
num = 1
while num <= 10:
    print(num)
    num += 1  # Increment to avoid infinite loop
