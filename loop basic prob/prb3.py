3. Print each character in a string
------------------------------------
text = "Python"
for char in text:  # Iterate over each character
    print(char)
Explanation:

Strings are sequences. char becomes each character in order.

Alternative (index-based):
--------------------------------------


for i in range(len(text)):
    print(text[i])  # Access character by index
    # output: P, y, t, h, o, n
