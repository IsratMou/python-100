13. Clear all elements
==============================

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list.clear()  # Removes all elements
print(my_list)  # Output: []
Explanation: .clear() empties the list. Equivalent to del my_list[:].
del my_list[:] can also be used to clear the list. but it does not delete the list itself, just its contents.

del my_list[] deletes the list itself.
